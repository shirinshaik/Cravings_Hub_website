go to index.html to view the webpage but make sure you have all files at one place.
if you wish to make changes to the website, follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AStFtHJZ1Nk&list=PLnHJACx3NwAdhoqmE5i_dqSnYHd04doh0&index=2
filters and cookbook part is left. we have to do hard coding since we did not get started on the dataset. if either of you could make a dataset, that would be great.

I will also send some pictures on whatsapp group, which have the names of the recipes, which we can be found in the above links.
